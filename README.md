# React App with Material UI, YouTube API, and Supabase

## Introduction

This document provides a brief summary of a React app that utilizes Material UI, the YouTube API, and Supabase. The app includes basic functionalities such as searching, viewing, commenting, and liking videos.

## Technologies Used

1. React: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Material UI: The app incorporates Material UI, a UI component library that provides pre-built React components with a modern and visually appealing design.
3. YouTube API: The YouTube API allows the app to interact with YouTube's vast collection of videos, enabling functionalities like searching, viewing, and retrieving video data.
4. Supabase: Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides APIs and a PostgreSQL database. It is used in this app to handle user authentication, video metadata storage, and comment data.

## Features

1. Search: Users can search for videos by entering keywords or specific queries. The app sends requests to the YouTube API and displays the search results.
2. Video Viewing: Users can click on a video from the search results to view it within the app. The video player component is integrated with the YouTube API to retrieve and play the selected video.
3. Comments: Users can read and post comments on videos. The app interacts with the Supabase API to store and retrieve comment data associated with each video.
4. Likes: Users can like or dislike videos. The app tracks the user's preferences and updates the video's like count accordingly. The data is stored in the Supabase database.

## Workflow

1. User Interface: The app's user interface is built using React components from Material UI, providing a clean and intuitive design for seamless user experience.
2. YouTube API Integration: The app utilizes the YouTube API to fetch video data, search results, and play videos within the app's interface.
3. Supabase Integration: Supabase is used for user authentication, storing video metadata, comment data, and handling likes.
4. Search Functionality: When a user enters a search query, the app sends a request to the YouTube API, retrieves the search results, and displays them on the interface.
5. Video Viewing: When a user selects a video from the search results, the app retrieves the video's details from the YouTube API and displays it in a video player component.
6. Commenting: Users can read existing comments and post their own comments on the video. The app communicates with the Supabase API to store and retrieve comment data.
7. Likes: Users can like or dislike videos, and the app updates the like count accordingly. The Supabase database is used to store and retrieve like data.

## Conclusion

This React app integrates Material UI for a visually appealing design, utilizes the YouTube API for video retrieval and playback, and leverages Supabase for user authentication, video metadata storage, comment data, and likes. The app enables users to search, view, comment on, and like videos, creating an engaging and interactive experience for users.
